# Feedreader Testing
===============================

## Description

This project from the Udacity Frontend Developer Nanodegree is about app testing with Jasmine.

For this already existing RSS-Feed App the goal was to write testing suites with Jasmine to determine if the functionalities work like they are supposed to.


## Install

- Download the project on Github: [Feed Reader Testing](https://github.com/kmarryo/feedreader)

The test suites can be found in 'jasmine/spec/feedreader.js'

## Getting started
Open the index.html

- in your **local webserver**

OR

- by clicking on it and open it right away in your browser.

## Used techniques
- Jasmine
- jQuery

## Test suites

Tests that are programmed and executed by Jasmine:

- The allFeeds variable is defined and not empty (there are feeds available)
- Feeds have a URL provided
- Every feed has a name provided
- Menu bar is hidden by default.
- Menu bar gets visible by click on the menu toggle icon and gets invisible again on another click
- At least one entry element is within the feed-container
- Checks if the content of the feeds actually changes when a new feed is loaded
